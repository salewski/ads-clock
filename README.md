# ads-clock

The `ads-clock` program allows you to use your terminal as a clock.

Got a laptop that you plug into a much larger display? Rather than close the
lid on the laptop or otherwise abandon it while working on the larger display,
throw an `ads-clock` on that bad boy.

Stupid, I know...

Here's a screenshot from an xterm (stretched across most of the screen) on my
3200x1800 laptop display:
