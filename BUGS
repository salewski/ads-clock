This is the 'BUGS' file for the 'ads-clock' project.

The preferred way to report bugs (and suggest new features) is via the GitHub
issues page for the project:

    https://github.com/salewski/ads-clock/issues

On that page, simply click on the "New issue" button and then type in the
issue description as described below.

Alternatively, you can also send bug reports to the author via email at:

    salewski@att.net

Be sure to indicate 'ads-clock' in the email subject line.

Please note that the author confesses to being hopelessly behind his email and
under-motivated to rectify the situation. He does read all of it eventually,
but it might be years before he sees your message and longer still before he
decides whether or not to act on it.

When reporting a bug, please include as much information as possible,
including (but not limited to):

    * host operating system (and version)

    * version of 'ads-clock' project you are using

    * name of the program, file, or whatever that contains the bug

    * what the observed behavior was

    * what the expected behavior was

    * any specific steps that need to be performed in sequence in order
      to produce the bug

    * file(s) of the input that causes the buggy behavior

    * file(s) of any broken output

In short, include anything that will help us to reproduce the bug, as this
will /greatly increase/ the likelyhood of the bug getting fixed and will
/greatly decrease/ the amount of time before we can make a new release with
the bug fix.
