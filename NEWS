This is the 'NEWS' file for the 'ads-clock' project. This file contains
information on changes since the last release of the package, as well as a
running list of high-level changes from previous versions.  If critical bugs
are found in any of the software, notice of such bugs and the versions in
which they were fixed will be noted here, as well.

ads-clock 0.1.0 (TBD)

    * Initial version of project. The project currently provides two command
      line programs: `ads-clock` and `ads-clock-once`.

      + ads-clock-once: prints a "single tick" of a large (non-ugly, it is
        hoped) clock in your terminal window. The date displayed in the fixed
        format:

            YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ssSOO:oo

        where

            YYYY means date fullyear (4 digits); 0000-9999
              MM means date month    (2 digits); 01-12
              DD means date mday     (2 digits); 01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31 based on month/year

              HH means time hour     (2 digits); 00-23
              mm means time minute   (2 digits); 00-59
              ss means time second   (2 digits); 00-58, 00-59, 00-60 based on leap second rules

               S means one of the signs '+' or '-'

              OO means time hours offset from UTC
              oo means time minuts offset from UTC

        which is compliant with RFC 3336 (mainly a "profile" of ISO-8601,
        except that it allows a space rather than a 'T' to separate dates from
        times).

        The 'HH:mm:ss' portion of the display is shown in cyan to have it
        stand out from the surrounding text. That works pretty well, assuming
        the default color of your terminal text is not cyan. No facility is
        provided in this initial version to control the color.

      + ads-clock: is the driver program, and the only one of the two that is
        intended to be invoked directly by the user. It uses `watch(1)` to
        invoke `ads-clock-one` every second, which produces the effect of a
        clock on the terminal updating every second.
